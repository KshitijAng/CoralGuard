# **CoralGuard**

CoralGuard is an innovative app dedicated to safeguarding marine ecosystems by assessing coral health using cutting-edge AI technology. It empowers users to contribute actively to global marine 
conservation efforts while preserving the beauty and vitality of coral reefs for future generations.

# **About the Project**
CoralGuard was developed by Kshitij Angurala and Kanishka, students at UPES Dehradun, as a part of their exploration into the latest advancements in deep learning and computer vision. 
The project demonstrates their commitment to leveraging AI for environmental conservation.

The development process involved extensive research and experimentation with several state-of-the-art models, including:

- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image recognition and feature extraction.
- Attention Mechanisms for improving model accuracy.
- Region-Based Models like Fast R-CNN for precise object detection and classification.
This comprehensive approach ensures high accuracy in coral health assessments, contributing meaningfully to the global fight against marine ecosystem degradation.

# **Key Features**
- Upload and Assess: Users can upload coral images to evaluate their health using AI-based analysis.
- Advanced AI Models: Implements state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to ensure precise and reliable results.
- Conservation Contribution: Helps researchers and conservationists monitor coral health and track ecosystem changes over time.

# **How It Works**
- Upload an image of coral via the app interface.
- The app processes the image using trained AI models to assess the coral's health.
- Results are displayed, offering insights into the coral's condition, which can support conservation efforts.

# **Technologies Used**
- Deep Learning Frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch
- Computer Vision Models: CNNs, Attention Mechanisms, Fast R-CNN
- Programming Language: Python
- Others: Streamlit, Groq
